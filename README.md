# MCP Inspector (Client-Side)

A lightweight, fully client-side tool for testing MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers using streamable HTTP — no server-side dependencies required.

## Overview

This tool was built to provide a developer-friendly way to test MCP-compatible servers directly from the browser. Unlike existing solutions that rely on server-side intermediaries, this inspector is designed to run entirely on the client-side, making it easy to integrate into any web application or frontend project.

## Features

- ✅ **Client-Side Only**: Requires no backend or proxy. Communicates directly with MCP servers over streamable HTTP.
- 🔁 **Reusable**: Designed as a modular component that can be dropped into any frontend project.
- 🛠️ **Extensible**: Easily customizable and adaptable to suit different UI needs or workflows.
